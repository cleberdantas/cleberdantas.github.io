title: "Underscore.js - a lightweight and very helpful javascript library"
---

Underscore.js is a lightweight and very helpful javascript library, with only 5KB (minified and gzipped) it gives us about 80 functions to work with data structures and collections.

If you are a ASP.NET Developer you will realize that it is very similar with "LinqToSQL" but of course for javascript =D . (Which is amazing)

Today I'll show you 25 functions of 80, I splitted the code samples in this way: Collections, Arrays, Objects and Utilities, like Underscore.js web site.

See below:
