I’m a experienced software developer working more than 8 years in different kinds of business and companies like: Software Houses, Consulting Services and Internet.\\

My focus is on web development, In the past 5 years I’ve been worked in the entire delivery chain of web applications (from the user’s browsers to the servers behind the load balancers).\\

Performance and scalability are my daily basis concerns, so I need to have this always in mind when developing new stuff ( or perhaps maintain older stuff =) ).\\

I’m also a speaker in different technology community events in Brazil like: MS Dev Day, MsTechDay, MVC Summit, Saturday Fast Code, TechEd Brasil 2011, The Developers Conference 2012 (TDC) and others. You can see more here http://lanyrd.com/profile/cleberdantas/sessions/\\

As a instructor, I like to teach about web development (ASP.NET MVC, Best Practices, Web Performance techniques and so forth).\\

I’ve attended some great conferences like: QCon Sao Paulo (2011, 2012), QCon London (2011, 2012, 2013), Velocity Conf Europe (Berlin 2011 and London 2012), TecheEd Brasil (2009, 2010, 2011), BrazilJS (2011, 2012), The Developers Conference (2012) and others.\\
